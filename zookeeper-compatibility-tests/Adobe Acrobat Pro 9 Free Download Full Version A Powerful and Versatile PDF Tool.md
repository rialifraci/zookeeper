# How to Download Adobe Acrobat Pro 9 for Free
 
If you are looking for a way to download Adobe Acrobat Pro 9 for free, you might be disappointed to know that Adobe has discontinued the support and availability of this software since June 2015. However, there are still some ways to get your hands on this older version of Acrobat Pro if you have a valid serial key or if you are willing to use an unofficial source.
 
One option is to check your Adobe account online and see if you have registered your Acrobat Pro 9 software with Adobe. If you have, you might be able to find the download link in your order history or product downloads section. You can also try contacting Adobe support and provide proof of purchase to request a download link. However, this might not work as Adobe has removed the download links for Acrobat 9 from their website.

Another option is to use a third-party website that hosts the ISO file for Acrobat Pro 9. For example, you can try the Internet Archive website[^1^] [^3^] and search for "Adobe Acrobat Professional 9". You should be able to find an item that contains the ISO file that you can download and burn to a CD or mount to a virtual drive. However, this method is not recommended as it might not be legal or safe. You should also be aware that the ISO file might not contain the latest updates or patches for Acrobat Pro 9, and that you might encounter compatibility or security issues when running it on newer operating systems.
